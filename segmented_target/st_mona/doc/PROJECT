Project description:

A number of particles should be tracked (propagated) through a system
of beam line elements.  Beam line elements include simple drift,
energy loss, magnet maps,... and also targets, where reactions can
take place.  There are beam line elements (BLE) that 

 - change the (z) position of a particle (drift or magnet map),
 - do not change the position, but the energy or angle of a particle

For the whole propagation the z-coordinate is the main parameter and
no time steps are performed.

The particle number can change, e.g. a reaction can take place.

There can also be abstrace BLE, like 'print particle positions to
stdout'.

All BLE have a definite Z position and a drift is inserted if previous
particle-z does not match

Initialization:

The particle data is initialized by an initializer (e.g. everything
random, using phase space ellipse, using data...)



Histograming and n-tuple filling:

After every action certain values of the particles and results of
action (e.g. energy loss) can be filled in histograms and n-tuple
fields.
