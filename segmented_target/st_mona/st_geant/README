COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

To compile st_geant, run the compile.sh executable:

> ./compile.sh

You need to be on a 64-bit "fishtank" machine and have the proper 
PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables set in order to run
the program or to compile it.

Your PATH needs to include:

/projects/proj6/mona-sim/soft/root/root_v5.12_00/bin/
                          and
/projects/proj6/mona-sim/soft/root/root_v5.12_00/include/


Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to include:

/projects/proj6/mona-sim/soft/root/root_v5.12_00/lib/

If this is not the case, then you can make it so by typing:

> export ROOTSYS=/projects/proj6/mona-sim/soft/root/root_v5.12_00/
> export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin/:$ROOTSYS/include/:$PATH
> export LD_LIBRRY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(You might want to add these lines to your ~/.bashrc file so that 
the right PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are set every time you start a
session.)
