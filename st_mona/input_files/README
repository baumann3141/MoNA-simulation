README!

These directories contain PREMADE and INCOMPLETE input files for each experiement in ST_MoNA.
IMPORTANT: THE COSY MAP IS NOT IN THESE PREMADE FILES YOU MUST INCLUDE IT BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:

You must add: cosymap = "name of cosy map";
With that syntax, as the quotes let the code know you are inputing a string.

WARNING: Watch out for whitespaces and blank lines, and possibly faulty comments (#).
