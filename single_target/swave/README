Two steps: run the phase shift calculation, then run the phase shift to cross-section calculation. You'll need to be able to log in to fishtank without entering a password. 

Phase shift calculation:
Everything you need is in Phaseshift_Art. The main script it phase_search.py. You're iterating through potential depths. The basic idea is that the core nucleus + neutron hit the target, causing the neutron to fly off. The output of this calculation is phase_ang.dat, which is the input for the next step. Things you'll want to change (or at least think about changing):
	- Potentials
	- A and Z of core nucleus
	- Nsteps, deltastep to match your histogram. Nsteps maxes out at 300, for some reason I haven't yet discovered.
	- File to copy phase_ang.dat to (end of shell command sequence at bottom of script)

To run phase shift calculations:
> ipython
> %run phase_search.py

The output from this script includes the phaseshift files (which were written to phase_ang.dat and then copied at the end of the script) and pot_scat.dat, which lists the potentials and the associated scattering lengths (though it doesn't start a new file, just adds on to the end). If you'd like to calculate the estimated energies associated with these scattering states, you can use the calc_energy.sh script.

Cross-section calculation:
Everything you need is in the main folder. You'll need to edit stuff in cross_worker.py and cross_server.py. In cross_worker, you'll need to change:
	- Path of crosscalc_C.so
	- ccalc.v (velocity of beam in cm/ns)
	- ccalc.ei (binding energy of incident beam)
	- ccalc.rs (strong absorption radius, 1.2*(RMS of core and target), also known as the contact length)
	- ccalc.de (needs to match deltastep)
	- ccalc.dz (steps along z)
	- ccalc.db (impact parameter)
	- QueueManager address. First argument is the element computer from which you will run the program, second is the port number (should be unique). Authkey can be anything as long as it matches the authkey in cross_server.
	- pool_size (how many processors do you want to use?)

In cross_server, you'll need to change:
	- QueueManager port number and authkey. The first argument (where previously the initial computer name was, can just be an empty string (''). Port number and authkey should be the same as cross_worker.
	- deltaE needs to be the same as deltaE from the phase shift calculation.
	- Path to cross_worker.py.
	- Path to location of phase shift files.

To run cross-section calculations:
Access the computer names in the QueueManager call in cross_worker.py. (Currently helium).
Then navigate to the swave directory and type:
> ipython
> %run cross_server.py
